# Asynchronicity

Implement a function that takes an array and a key to search for and counts the
number of times key matches an element in the array (the count matches function
we talked about in lectures). Your implementation must count the number of
matches asynchronously, but does not need to do so in parallel. What type of
asynchronous execution you choose is up to you.

I have not provided a template; depending on how you choose to implement the
function, it will have a different signature. I have also not provided any test
code, but you can base yours on test code from other exercises.

The [async library](https://caolan.github.io/async/v3/) may be helpful with
this.

## Runtime Analysis

What is the time complexity of your implementation (worst-case $\Theta$)? Add
your answer, including your reasoning, to this markdown file.  


**QUESTION**:
I did what you asked and added a test case that was ran in the callback function.  
However, I've found that I can only run 1 test before my code starts runnning into  
errors. Is there any way you can think of that would allow me to run multiple tests?  
Once again, I'm very sorry to bother you with these questions, but the idea of debugging  
and testing asynchronous functions wasn't something we went over in class so I'm a little  
confused on that topic.
